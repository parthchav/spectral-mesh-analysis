    "# 01 — Constructing the Discrete Laplacian\n",
    "\n",
    "In $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the continuous setting, the Laplacian $\\Delta$ is analytically defined as $$\\Delta = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_{j}^{2}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "On a curved surface, the corresponding generalization is the *Laplace-Beltrami operator*. In practise, we represent surfaces as triangle meshes and discretize Laplacian as a  matrix. In this notebook, we will study the laplacian in this discrete setting. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "In the continuous setting, the laplacian acts on functions or surfaces. This raises the natural question: **What does the discrete laplacian act on?** To answer this we introduce some terminology. Assume the mesh has $V$ vertices. A scalar function on the mesh is just a vector\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u \\in \\mathbb{R}^V,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $u_i$ is the value of the function at vertex $i$.  A discrete Laplacian is a $V\\times V$ matrix $L$ such that $(Lu)_i$ approximates “how $u$ bends” near vertex $i$. We now introduce two common ways to define the Laplacian on meshes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Uniform graph Laplacian: \n",
    "\n",
    "This version only uses *connectivity* of the graph, not geometry. We first introduce two common matrices related to graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *adjacency matrix* $A$ associated to a graph $(V,E)$ is a $|V| \\times |V|$ matrix defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A_{ij} =\n",

    "\n",
    "**Downside:** it treats every edge equally, even if some triangles are smaller or edges are long/short. So it doesnt provide a very accurate description of the $3$-d structure of the mesh.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2) Cotangent Laplacian \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the standard Laplace–Beltrami discretization for triangle meshes and takes into account the angles between edges. Thus in a sense its more geometry aware than the Unifrom graph laplacian.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $(i,j)$ is a **boundary edge**, there is only one incident triangle, so we only ave one angle and the other term is treated as $0$.\n",

    "$\n",
    "L_{ii} = -\\sum_{j\\neq i} L_{ij}.\n",
